It is a powerful LLM engine that can assist with data modeling and transformation, as well as generating test questions for proprietary data. It can also be used for AI-driven use cases that run on private repositories. Lamini can also be deployed on your own infrastructure. Please reach out to the Lamini team for more details.\"},\n",
       " {'question': '### Question:\\nHow does Lamini differ from LangChain in terms of their core functionality?\\n\\n### Answer:',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Lamini and LangChain differ in their core functionality. Lamini is primarily focused on enabling developers, regardless of their machine learning expertise, to train high-performing language models easily. It emphasizes model customization and offers a user-friendly interface. LangChain, on the other hand, is designed for working with chains and sequences of calls involving language models and other utilities. It provides a standard interface and integrations for complex workflows.'},\n",
       " {'question': '### Question:\\nAre there any tutorials on using Lamini for text classification tasks?\\n\\n### Answer:',\n",
       "  'answer': 'See the Lamini documentation here: https://lamini-ai.github.io/ for example walkthroughs you might extend or modify to do text classification. In particular, think about what input and output types may help you classify text.'},\n",
       " {'question': '### Question:\\nCan Lamini be used for real-time or online learning scenarios?\\n\\n### Answer:',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Yes, Lamini can be used for real-time or online learning scenarios. It supports incremental learning and continuous improvement of language models based on real-time data streams. Lamini also provides mechanisms for model versioning, model management, and model deployment pipelines, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications.'},\n",
       " {'question': '### Question:\\nI am running into error 500, what should I do?\\n\\n### Answer:',\n",
       "  'answer': 'We have documentation available on how to address common errors here https://lamini-ai.github.io/error_handling/. Lamini’s LLM Engine is under very active development, and we thank you for using us!'},\n",
       " {'question': '### Question:\\nWhy are pineapples yellow\\n\\n### Answer:',\n",

       " {'question': '### Question:\\nAre there any known limitations or challenges when using Lamini with non-English languages?\\n\\n### Answer:',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Lamini does offer support for non-English languages during customization and inference, but there may be some limitations or challenges depending on the specific language and the availability of training data. It is recommended to consult the Lamini documentation and seek expert advice when working with non-English languages.'},\n",
       " {'question': '### Question:\\nHow does the Lamini library handle rare or out-of-vocabulary words during the generation of text outputs?\\n\\n### Answer:',\n",
       "  'answer': 'The Lamini library uses a subword tokenizer to handle rare or out-of-vocabulary words during text generation. This tokenizer splits words into smaller subword units, allowing the model to handle unseen words by composing them from known subwords.'},\n",
